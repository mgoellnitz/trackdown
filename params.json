A lightweight Ticketing System for distributed and unconnected small Teams.","body":"# TrackDown\r\n\r\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/mgoellnitz/trackdown.svg)](https://github.com/mgoellnitz/trackdown/blob/master/LICENSE)\r\n\r\nIssue Tracking with plain [Markdown][markdown].\r\n\r\nIn short: You are missing the \"git clone\" for your tickets from [github.com][github]\r\nor [bitbucket.org][bitbucket] where we already have this for code and wiki?\r\n\r\nYou need issue tracking which works for distributed and potentially disconnected\r\nsituations together with your distributed version control [GIT][git] and e.g. your\r\nalso distributed wiki editing through [GIT][git] as well?\r\n\r\nThen this here is for you!\r\n\r\nIt is not intended for large, permanently online or connected teams and heavy flows\r\nof tickets though, since you will be having only one file a plain [Markdown][markdown]\r\nwith your issues - and optionally other stuff - collected in it.\r\n\r\n\r\n# The Format\r\n\r\nWhile sticking to only partly structured [Markdown][markdown] the following elements\r\nshould be maintainable with TrackDown:\r\n\r\n- ID\r\n- Title\r\n- Status\r\n- Commits\r\n- Target Version\r\n- Severity\r\n- Affected Versions\r\n- Description\r\n- Comments\r\n\r\nThese fields are mapped to the following source structure\r\n\r\n```\r\n  ## ID Title (status)\r\n\r\n  ### severity priority\r\n\r\n  ### Target Version (optional)\r\n\r\n  affected versions: 1.0, 1.1 (optional - structured)\r\n\r\n  ### Description (optional)\r\n\r\n  description\r\n\r\n  ### Comments (optional)\r\n\r\n  comments (structured)\r\n\r\n  ### Commits (auto generated)\r\n\r\n  The headline commits at level three is optional. The commit messages are inserted\r\n  just as the last part of the issue's level two text area.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe really fixed non optional parts of this are\r\n\r\n```\r\n  ## ID Title (status)\r\n\r\n  (Commit messages inserted here before the next ticket)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Field Values\r\n\r\n### ID\r\n\r\nAny combination of (english) upper- and lower-case letters and digits.\r\n\r\n### Title\r\n\r\nAny expressible in Markdown.\r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nAnything expressible in Markdown. Automatically set values are \"in progress\" if\r\nyou start committing for a certain ID and \"resolved\", if you are using a prefix\r\nof \"fixes ID\" or \"resolves ID\".\r\n\r\nOther intended values inlude \"new\", where the issue is just files, and \"closed\"\r\nwhen the solution is brought into production.\r\n\r\n### Target Version\r\n\r\nAnything expressible in Markdown.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  Future-Work Will be evaluated to calculate your project's roadmap\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAnything expressible in Markdown.\r\n\r\n### Affected Versions\r\n\r\nAnything expressible in Markdown. Is expected to describe which version are\r\naffected by the issue (if this is possible to say).\r\n\r\n### Comments\r\n\r\nAnything expressible in Markdown.\r\n\r\n### Severity\r\n\r\nAnything expressible in Markdown.\r\n\r\n# Commands in the commit messages\r\n\r\nRight now TrackDown understands only two commands in the commit messages.\r\n\r\n## refs *id*\r\n\r\nReference the commit in the list of commits at the end of the issue text.\r\n\r\nThis command changes the state to \"in progress\" from anything like new, nothing,\r\nor even resolved\r\n\r\n```\r\n  (Future work: lifts the issue up to the top of the list)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## resolves|fixes *id*\r\n\r\nReference the commit in the list of commits at the end of the issue text.\r\n\r\nThis command changes the state to \"resolved\" from anything like new, nothing, or\r\nin progress\r\n\r\n```\r\n  (Future work: moves the issue to the top the part of the list where the resolved issues reside)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Setup\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to setup TrackDown. The default way is to use it in a\r\nseparate branch of you source code repository and have it editable in your IDE\r\nthrough a symbolic link to the issue collection file which is maintained by you\r\nthrough direct typing or the commit hook integration.\r\n\r\nThe second way is to use the file at a different location - e.g. in the wiki of\r\nthe project instead of the source code repository, which is described later.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Initialize the Repository\r\n\r\nIf you want to track the issues in a trackdown branch of your source code\r\nrepository, you need to modify the [GIT][git] repository accordingly. To initialize\r\na [GIT][git] repository that way call the script\r\n\r\n```\r\n  trackdown.sh init\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis creates the TrackDown thread for the issue tracking. You have to manually\r\npropagate this thread to your upstream repositories. TrackDown does not\r\ninterfere with your remote workflow.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  git push original trackdown\r\n```\r\n\r\nInitialization must only to be executed once for a repository and all of its\r\nfork and clones.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use the issue collection file from a different location, leave\r\nout this step.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Repository Integration\r\n\r\nRegardless of the location of the issue collection file, for each clone of the\r\nrepository you have to set up the TrackDown tooling to be able to use it\r\nintegrated with your source code [GIT][git] commits.\r\n\r\nTo start using TrackDown for the respective clone you have to issue\r\n\r\n```\r\n  trackdown.sh use\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen using the TrackDown branch in the source code repository or\r\n\r\n```\r\n  trackdown.sh use <path/to/issues.md>\r\n```\r\n\r\nlike in\r\n\r\n```\r\n  trackdown-use.sh ../wiki/issues.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen using TrackDown with the issue collection file at a different location.\r\nAutomatic commit and push (see below) will be switched of in the latter case.\r\n\r\nThis creates a gitignored link issues.md in the root directory of your project\r\npointing to the issue collection file and it will configure a post-commit hook\r\nfor [GIT][git].\r\n\r\nAfter this step you can edit the issue collection file following the format\r\nmentioned here.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Configuration\r\n\r\nThe source tree contains a directory named .trackdown.\r\n\r\nThis directory contains a file named config. There are some options in this\r\nfile, which you can change.\r\n\r\nExample config file for TrackDown:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  autocommit=true\r\n  autopush=false\r\n  location=../wiki/issues.md\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n  (Future Work: It also contains a file named trackdown.sh update for TrackDown updates)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Auto Commit all Issue Collection Changes\r\n\r\nAutomatically commits the new change to the trackdown branch. If you didn't\r\nchange the default location where your normal source code repository contains\r\nthe trackdown branch will want to leave the unchanged to true.\r\n\r\nIn other scenarios you may switch it to false.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Auto Push all Issue Collection Commits\r\n\r\nAutomatically pushes after each commit to the upstream repository. If you didn't\r\nchangethe default locations where your normal source code repository is the\r\nupstream repositoryof your issue collection you will want to leave the unchanged\r\nto *true*.\r\n\r\nIn other scenarios you may switch it to false. E.g. if the issue collection is\r\npart of your project wiki then automatically pushing might lead to remote\r\noperations whichis not desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nJust copy the files from bin to you /usr/local/bin or somewhere else on your $PATH\r\nfor now. Perhaps we will add something more convenient later.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Issues\r\n\r\n## ROADMAP related features need to be implemented.\r\n\r\nTrackDown is promised to deal with a sorting features for issues to group them into\r\nSprints, Release, or the like. This feature is completely missing right now.\r\n\r\n## COPY release notes.\r\n\r\nWhen closing a release or sprint, it should be possible to copy all the resolved\r\nissues to a new [Markdown][markdown] file to remove the from the issues collection\r\nand have a contribution to release notes.\r\n\r\n## MULTIISSUE There can be only one issue per ticket.\r\n\r\n[markdown]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/\r\n[git]: http://git-scm.com/\r\n[trac]: http://trac.edgewall.org/\r\n[bitbucket]: https://bitbucket.org/\r\n[fossil]: http://fossil-scm.org/index.html/doc/trunk/www/index.wiki\r\n[github]: https://github.com/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

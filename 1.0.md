# Issues resolved in 1.0

## ASSIGNMENT of issues should be part of the format and tooling (resolved)

*1.0*

We need a facility to deal with assignments of tickets to illustrate, who
is currently working on an issue at least as an optional part of the format.

Additionally some support in the tooling is needed to list issues assigned
to the current user

## COPY release notes. (resolved)

## SETUP tracking repository symmetrically (resolved)

*1.0*

The local tracking branch with its special checkout should be set up 
symmetrically to the root repository checkout with simple push style and user 
and email taken from the root repository.

    fixes #SETUP of tracking branch origin

## SYNCHRONIZE roadmap also on unhandled commits (resolved)

*1.0*

The roadmap file should be updated on every commit since there might be
changes in the issue collection file not produced by the commit hook script - 
e.g. by manual modification - which still might affect the roadmap.

Martin Goellnitz / Wed Nov 9 01:26:57 2016 [b5187ae2af3e8718fc943ccc21bbe1fd91458174](https://github.com/mgoellnitz/trackdown/commit/b5187ae2af3e8718fc943ccc21bbe1fd91458174)

## ROOT directory of the source code must be a valid roadmap and issue file location (resolved)

*1.0*

Due to forced set of symbolic links in the root directory of the source code
respository to the roadmap and issue collection file, the 'use' step fails.

Martin Goellnitz / Tue Sep 6 21:29:12 2016 +0200

    refs #ROOT - make root directory of source code a valid place for the issue collection file and roadmap file

## UPDATE command for the commit hook (resolved)

*1.0*

Add an update command so that the commit hook can be updated alongside the
tool script to be in sync.

## HASH of the commit should be part of the listing (resolved)

*1.0*

When adding a commit note to the issue collection file, the hash of that
commit should be part of the message alongside with the date and author.

## PREFIX hashes in commit notes to form a URL (resolved)

*1.0*

Many git implementations provide links to single commits with their changes
and other information. Provide configuration options for TrackDown to extend
the commit hashes to full URLs when adding a commit note to the issues 
collection file resulting in callable HTTP-links.

## MULTIISSUE There can be only one issue per commit. (resolved)

Martin Goellnitz Tue Dec 6 18:52:52 2016

    fixes #MULTIISSUE needed documentation and a fix

## MERCURIAL support should be added with the same functionality as GIT (resolved)

*1.0*

Like the scenario where TrackDown is used with a special branch within your
GIT repository, this setup can also be achieved with Mercurial / hg.
